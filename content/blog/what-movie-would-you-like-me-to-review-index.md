As title says, I will review movies, but I want you to tell me which movies would you like me to review, and where can I find them. You can tell me by submitting the form below:

<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify-recaptcha="true" data-netlify="true">
  <p><input type="text" name="movie" placeholder="Movie"/><p/>
<div data-netlify-recaptcha="true"></div>
<p><input type="text" name="where" placeholder="Where can I find it?"/><p/>
<button type="submit">Submit!</button>
</form>

Or, if you donÂ´t want to submit a form, you can reply to my tweet :)

Feel free to ask whenever you want. Even if it's been eighty years since I posted this. Chao!
