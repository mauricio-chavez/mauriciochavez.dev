Well, I guess this is my first post. You're probably wondering how I ended up
here. Let me introduce you:

I am currently a Computer Science student at 
(School of Science, UNAM)[http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/] and I'm working as web 
developer at a consultory named Klatus. I'm a passionate of web technologies, 
mostly, back-end technologies.

> I have worked with Python and Django, Java and, lately, with Javascript, 
> Express, React and all this stuff.

I was on my way to become a [React](https://reactjs.org/) ninja, when I 
read about something called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). So 
I read what GatsbyJS is and got so excited!
I thinked, _WOW, now I can write a blog!_ ðŸ˜Ž I've always wanted to write
a blog, and now I can do it with the power of React and Javascript.

I hope to see you around, guys! If you want something, contact me via Twitter.
I will answer whatever thing you ask me. Complains and suggestions allowed. ðŸ¤–

By the way, I leave you a cowboy llama, because is lovely! Sayonara.
